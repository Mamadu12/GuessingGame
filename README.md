# GuessingGame
A little play in C++, which I called guessing game. 
This game generate random numbers where you will have to guess what number the emulator has selected. 
In case if your chosen number is maller than the emulator number
it will ask you to guess again and will let you know if your selected number is too high or too low 
and onced guessed it will display the total number of attempts made.
